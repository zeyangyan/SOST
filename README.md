# SOST
In traditional stellar spectral template libraries construction efforts, the construction is usually based on observed spectra or synthetic spectra. We propose a template library construction method, called UNST, which is different from previous methods. The method is based on generative adversarial networks
that separate and combine content features and style features of spectra through an auto-encoder. Notably, this method eliminates the need for spectral expertise and manual feature extraction. The cross-domain transfer of the synthetic spectra is
achieved through the generative adversarial process, effectively overcoming the synthetic gap between the synthetic spectra and the observed spectra that exists in the previous template libraryconstruction process.Importantly, this method does not require a
priori knowledge about the parameters of the observed spectra.
